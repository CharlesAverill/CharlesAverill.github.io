		Programming is an Art Form

		by Charles Averill


		The study of art, music, and expression as a whole is an integral aspect of the human experience. It is why we enforce fine arts classes in public secondary and postsecondary schools in the US, it is why we protect and preserve forms of art in museums and digital archives, and it is why the names of artists and musicians from generations past are still alive in the minds of those even untrained in fine art. Most humans will agree that art has intrinsic value, and that experiencing art is a positive experience for the mind and soul.

		The study of programming is not an integral aspect of the human experience. Where art can be found in cave paintings from tens of thousands of years ago, programs can only be found within a generation of writing this, so obviously humans must have got by somehow before the advent of computing. Programming classes are typically not mandatory anywhere, software preservation is in a notably abysmal state, although modern software is thankfully often backed up to multiple git repositories, and <abbr title="Here, 'famous programmers' refers to those at the bleeding edge of computing of their time, rather than industry figures such as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs">famous programmers</abbr> and pioneers of computing are quite unkown, even in programming circles.
		
		That the study of programming is not an integral aspect of the human experience has led to the misconception that the study of programming is not also a study of art. Unfortunately, this misconception that is held by the general populace has seeped into the field of Computer Science as well, and as a result many programmers asked will disagree that programming is an art form.
		
		I will analyze the studying of programming in three categories which apply to any craft: Magic, Tool, and Art. 
		
		
		PROGRAMMING AS MAGIC
		
		
		To any untrained observer, a craft is accomplished through magic. Not wizards-and-witches magic, but hand-wavy unexplained magic. High-level mathematics beyond calculus are a mystery to me, I do not understand how any meaningful conclusions can be drawn from such abstract suppositions, but the consensus in the field is that these conclusions are valid. Our brains have been conditioned by 200,000 years of specialization between members of society, so instead of worrying about why the higher-level math works, my brain dismisses it as magic and I move on with my life. Because most people are not trained in programming, this is how they see programming. It's why movie hackers who "break into the mainframe" are so prevalent in media.
		
		
		PROGRAMMING AS A TOOL
		
		
		There is no question that "Starry Night" is art, yet a paintbrush is also undoubtedly a tool. Programming is a tool as well, and serves logical, no-nonsense functions like scheduling, business administration, information transfer, etc.


		PROGRAMMING AS MAGIC


		I will analyze the study of programming in three levels, the first of which is "magic". Magic is how the general (untrained) populace understands complex programming. All humans have fundamental understanding of conditions, repetition, and arithmetic, but give a farmer, a stock broker, or a musician a Python interpreter and none will likely be able to perform logical and arithmetic operations to achieve a goal. While the average human has the knowhow to understand individual logical or arithmetic statements, the study of computers and computer languages is a prerequisite to writing code. Because most people are not trained in computing, they will perceive our logical statements in the same way that a fisherman will perceive the stock market, an economist will perceive electromagnetism, and an EE undergrad will perceive a non-platonic relationship: magic. As our species grew, humans took on unique roles in society and as a result, we've evolved to try not to comprehend whatever someone else is working on.


		PROGRAMMING AS A TOOL


		The next level of understanding programming is held widely by programmers and those who work with them (mathemeticians, engineers, researchers, etc.), "a tool". Programmers early in their career will understand how to write functions, classes, complex data structures, and more. However, it is likely that they have not yet been given the chance to spearhead or architect a project. To a programmer who does not routinely design software, and only spends time implementing, data structures will be viewed as hammers, functions as screwdrivers. Abstract concepts that are fundamental to our understanding of mathematics will be reduced to the concept of a tool that exists to perform a function.

		I speak for no other programmers, however I have found that this understanding of programming is the most common one. Primarily, it is a large portion of my peers in undergrad who view programming as a means to an end, a way to get rich churning out gunk for Google, a hammer that exists only to strike nails. I think this is disappointing, and a failure of the way we teach Computer Science as a field.

		This is not to say that utilizing programming for a day job is wrong, or that one who does so is incomplete or lesser. Programming <i>is</i> a tool, but it is also more. Utilizing this fact is key to drawing more meaning from using the tools programming provides us.
