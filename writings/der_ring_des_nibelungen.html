        Reflection and Analysis on Wagner's <em>Der Ring des Nibelungen</em>, or, <em>The Ring Cycle</em>
		by Charles Averill
		
		My first explicit introduction to The Ring Cycle was via <em>Alien: Covenant</em>. Peter Wayland, a character driven by the desire to live forever, asks his creation - the android David - to play a piece by Wagner. David chooses <em>The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla</em> from Act II of <em>Das Rheingold</em>, the first opera in the cycle. Peter asks for this performance as he has achieved a major goal - to create life. David later listens to this piece as he achieves a similar goal. Both occurences are accompanied by potent dramatic irony - Peter's accomplishment leads to a disappointing death, and (although unconfirmed) David's accomplishment is doomed to lurk in the shadows until its likely eradication. I listened to this piece for years after hearing it in the film, often attributing it to my own successes - also without giving it much thought. Much later I would understand the dramatic undertones of the piece - its subverted themes of hubris and ignorance. 
        
        I first heard the piece live at the Dallas Opera in February 2023. A full production with excellent visuals and performances, I once again took the music and accompanying story at face value - a tale of mythology, heroism, trickery, and treasure. It wasn't until this past week - as I attended all four operas of the Ring Cycle at the Dallas Symphony Orchestra - that I started thinking deeply about <em>Das Rheingold</em> and its successors. What follows is my account of the pieces, my interpretations for them, and how they reflect on me personally.

        <h2>Das Rheingold</h2>
        <em>Das Rheingold</em> introduces the central MacGuffin of our story: the <b>Rhinegold</b>, magical gold tucked away at the bottom of a river near The Rhine, a mountain. The Rhinegold can only be acquired by he who renounces love. Upon acquiring it, the Rhinegold may be fashioned into a ring said to give the owner great power, enough to rule the world. 

        Act I presents the <b>Rhinemaidens</b>: protectors of the Rhine and its gold. They revel in the beauty of the morning sun as a trancelike backtrack lulls the listener into a comfortable state. Their voices are clear and beautiful - they represent the delicate and precious harmony of nature and all of its constituents. They are interrupted by the dwarf <b>Alberich</b> who seeks to seduce and wed one of the maidens. Each of the three maidens toys with Alberich before rejecting him, until he notices the gleam of the Rhinegold from beneath the water. Upon learning its nature, Alberich rejects love and steals the gold, much to the woe of the Rhinemaidens.

        <em>Das Rheingold</em> presents us with the initial sin of the Ring Cycle, one that will reappear countless times by nearly every party concerned with the story: theft. Alberich has not only stolen a lump of gold, but he has set in motion a massive chain of events that renders the world near-unrecognizable - he has stolen its innocence. For his crime, Alberich may never feel love or feel loved - a state that he begrudingly accepts. The theme of one being overpowered by love is frequently experienced throughout the Cycle - has Alberich doomed himself, or saved himself from the clutches of an unconquerable force?
