# github-cards
Embed cards for your repos with GitHub cards.

Getting started is easy, simple link to gh-cards.js and add the following anywhere in your HTML ->
```
<div class="gh-card gh-medium" data-repo="aranscope/github-cards"></div>
```
You can additionally specify a custom image, instead of using your github profile image ->
```
<div class="gh-card gh-large" data-repo="aranscope/github-cards" data-image="some image url"></div>
```
